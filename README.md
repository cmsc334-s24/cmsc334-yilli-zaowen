## Project Proposal

Our project will have features including but not limit to:

- Build a password manager: Develop a basic password manager application that securely stores, generates, and retrieves passwords for the user.
- Password Strength Analyzer: Build an application that evaluates the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and the use of common password pitfalls.
- Develop a Basic Cryptography Application: Create an application that implements basic cryptographic algorithms for encrypting and decrypting text messages.

Core Features:

- Give user rating of a password(weak, medium, strong)
    - Using simple algorithms on string and use regular expression
- If the password from the user is not strong enough, offer a strong password suggestion
    - Random + certain pattern
- Hash password and store on a server
    - Need to figure out server side, and SQL(maybe)
- Give user password back when he/she needs
